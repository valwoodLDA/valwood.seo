# ValWood SEO Helper

This repository contains static SEO support files for **ValWood Construção e Remodelação, LDA** (Leiria, Portugal).

## Purpose
ValWood.pt is built on Canva, which limits direct SEO control (head tags, canonicals, sitemap placement).  
This repo provides a **crawlable helper page** and related files to ensure proper Google indexing.

## Files
- **index.html** – Minimal HTML page with keyword-rich internal links to ValWood’s service pages.
- **sitemap.xml** – Handwritten sitemap listing homepage and all service pages.
- **robots.txt** – Crawl instructions for search engines, pointing to the sitemap.

## Deployment
- Hosted via **GitHub Pages** at:  
  `https://yourusername.github.io/valwood-seo/`

- Subdomain mapping:  
  `seo.valwood.pt → yourusername.github.io`

## Usage
1. Keep `index.html` updated with correct service page URLs.  
2. Submit `sitemap.xml` in **Google Search Console** for both `valwood.pt` and `seo.valwood.pt`.  
3. Use `robots.txt` to ensure crawlability.  
4. Request indexing for individual Canva pages if needed.

## Notes
- Repo is public for transparency and easy crawling.
